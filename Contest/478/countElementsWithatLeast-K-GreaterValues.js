Hint

You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer k.
An element in nums is said to be qualified if there exist at least k elements in the array 
that are strictly greater than it.
Return an integer denoting the total number of qualified elements in nums.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,2], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
The elements 1 and 2 each have at least k = 1 element greater than themselves.
​​​​​​​No element is greater than 3. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
Since all elements are equal to 5, no element is greater than the other. 
Therefore, the answer is 0.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n == nums.length <= 105
    1 <= nums[i] <= 109
    0 <= k < n
