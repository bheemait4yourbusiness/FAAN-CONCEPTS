todo: 3734. Lexicographically Smallest Palindromic Permutation Greater Than Target
Hard
premium lock iconCompanies
Hint

You are given two strings s and target, each of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return the
string that is both a

of s and strictly greater than target. If no such permutation exists, return an empty string.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = "baba", target = "abba"
Output: "baab"
Explanation:

    The palindromic permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "abba" and "baab".
    The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than target is "baab".

Example 2:
Input: s = "baba", target = "bbaa"
Output: ""
Explanation:

    The palindromic permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "abba" and "baab".
    None of them is lexicographically strictly greater than target. Therefore, the answer is "".

Example 3:
Input: s = "abc", target = "abb"
Output: ""
Explanation:
s has no palindromic permutations. Therefore, the answer is "".

Example 4:
Input: s = "aac", target = "abb"
Output: "aca"
Explanation:

    The only palindromic permutation of s is "aca".
    "aca" is strictly greater than target. Therefore, the answer is "aca".

Constraints:

    1 <= n == s.length == target.length <= 300
    s and target consist of only lowercase English letters.
